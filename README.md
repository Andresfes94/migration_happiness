## Project Description



## Questions & Hypotheses



## Dataset



## Workflow



## Organization

We created a kanban board on Trello to organise and coordinate work among ourselves. That way, we could distinguish between tasks that needed to be done and tasks that would be nice to have if time permits. The kanban board also allowed us to assign tasks to one or more of us, making it easier to keep track of who was doing what. 

Our repository contains the following files:
- this README file
- csv files:  
- jupyter notebook files:
