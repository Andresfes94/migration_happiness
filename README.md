## Project Description



## Questions & Hypotheses


Particular migration processes like the case between Colombia and Venezuela are well known and documented. As mentioned Martinez in [her work](https://repository.ucatolica.edu.co/bitstream/10983/3107/4/TESINA%20EL%20PROCESO%20MIGRATORIO%20ENTRE%20COLOMBIA%20Y%20VENEZUELA%201989%202014%20%20PRINCIPALES%20CAUSAS%20Y%20EFECTOS%20P.pdf), among other factors the violence, the lack of opportunities  and the poor administration management  in the country of origin  have been the main reasons of migration between this two countries. The language  facility and cultural   proximity are also a decisive factor in this circumstances.

## Workflow



## Organization

We created a kanban board on Trello to organise and coordinate work among ourselves. That way, we could distinguish between tasks that needed to be done and tasks that would be nice to have if time permits. The kanban board also allowed us to assign tasks to one or more of us, making it easier to keep track of who was doing what. 

Our repository contains the following files:
- this README file
- csv files:  
- jupyter notebook files:
